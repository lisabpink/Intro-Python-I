# JS objects 
# Swift dictionaries
# Java Hashmaps?

# init an empty dict 
d = {} 

# One primary use-case is to associate keys with values 
# Dicts provide very efficient fetching of keys 
# Dicts provide de-duplication functionality since they 
# never store duplicates of any keys 

# create a dict with two key-value pairs 
e = {"foo": 12, 11: "bar"}

# print out the value 12 from the dict 
print(e["foo"])
print(e[11])

# iterate through dict keys pairs 
for key in e:
    print(key, e[key])

# iterate through key-value pairs 
for key, val in e.items():
    print(f"Key is {key} and value is {val}")

# the `items` method on dicts is similar to the 
# `enumerate` function for lists in that both 
# give you access to index-value/key-value
